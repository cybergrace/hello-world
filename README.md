# hello-world
the friendly place

Hi, humans of the world. A lot of people on this planet believe they are equally as good, no better or worse, than any other person on this planet. Some people believe they are better and their countries are better and, because of this, their government has the right to take other country's stuff. Some of these greedy folks call this "Pax Americana." 

If you believe everyone is equal, please stay in this repository. If you don't, get out and be a jerk elsewhere.
